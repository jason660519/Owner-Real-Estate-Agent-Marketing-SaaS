# Meeting Minutes: Project Kickoff & Architecture Strategy

**Date:** January 8, 2026
**Attendees:** Jason (Product Owner), GitHub Copilot (AI Technical Consultant)

## 1. Agenda
*   Determine the best technical stack for the "Owner Real Estate Agent SaaS".
*   Discuss infrastructure strategy (Cloud vs. Home Lab).
*   Initialize project skeleton (Codebase Presentation).
*   Clarify the role of Odoo in the project.

## 2. Key Discussions & Decisions

### 2.1. Technical Stack Selection
*   **Discussion:** User required a robust architecture suitable for complex real estate flows (Owners, Agents, Renters, Buyers).
*   **Decision:**
    *   **Frontend:** Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui. (Reason: SEO for marketing, performance for dashboards).
    *   **Backend:** Python Django REST Framework. (Reason: Strong data modeling, easy to reference Odoo logic, secure).
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL. (Reason: Relational data integrity).
    *   **Architecture:** Modular Monolith (Start simple, scale later).

### 2.2. Infrastructure Strategy
*   **Discussion:** User proposed using a home PC with OpenStack to emulate AWS/GCP for hosting the SaaS.
*   **Consultant Advice:** OpenStack is too complex and resource-heavy for a single node. Recommended lightweight virtualization.
*   **Decision:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Development/Alpha):** Home Lab using **Proxmox VE + Docker Compose**.
    *   **Networking:** Use **Cloudflare Tunnel** to securely expose the home server to the internet without dangerous port forwarding.
    *   **Phase 2 (Production):** Migrate to Public Cloud (AWS/Vercel) when paying customers arrive.

### 2.3. The Role of Odoo
*   **Discussion:** Should we use the Odoo Real Estate package directly?
*   **Decision:** **No.** Odoo is an ERP monolith not suited for a high-performance, modern consumer-facing SaaS.
*   **Action:** Build a custom Django backend but use Odoo's open-source code as a "Reference Manual" for business logic and data models.

### 2.4. Project Initialization (Action Items Completed)
*   Established standard directory structure (`backend/`, `frontend/`).
*   Created `docker-compose.yml` for orchestration.
*   Created `Standards/` documentation (Skeleton, Infrastructure, Workflow).
*   Initialized Django project core files (Ongoing).

## 3. Conclusions & Next Steps
*   **Conclusion:** The project will proceed as a modern, decoupled web application (Headless Architecture). We will prioritize a solid development environment (Docker) to ensure the code can run anywhere (Home Lab or Cloud).
*   **Next Steps:**
    1.  [Running] Initialize Django Codebase.
    2.  [Pending] Initialize Next.js Codebase.
    3.  [Pending] User to install Proxmox on Home PC.

## 4. Strategy Update (Post-Meeting Pivot)
*   **Pivot Decision:** Shift from "Infrastructure First" to **"Application First"**.
*   **Reasoning:**
    *   Found that focusing on scaling hardware (K8s nodes) too early was blocking software progress.
    *   The powerful local hardware (16 Core / 64GB) is best used to facilitate a smooth Docker development environment first, rather than complex cluster management.
*   **New Roadmap:**
    1.  **Phase 1:** Dockerize everything (Local dev).
    2.  **Phase 2:** Build MVP Business Logic (Django/Next.js).
    3.  **Phase 3:** Deploy to Proxmox VM (Simulate Prod).
    4.  **Phase 4:** Migrate to AWS (Real Scale).
*   **Immediate Action:** User requested a complete project plan based on this new 4-phase strategy. (Files created in `Project_Roadmap/`).
